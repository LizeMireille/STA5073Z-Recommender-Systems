abstract="Recommender systems are an integral part of many of today's major web sites and online services and they widely exert their influence on which content users come across in the online world. From an organizational and economic perspective, recommender systems are designed to increase the quality of matches between users and items or content and this way create value for the different stakeholders. They do so, for instance, by reducing consumers' information overload or by helping to improve business-oriented performance indicators. However, notwithstanding of the actual achievement of concrete goals or targets, recommender systems have an impact on users' choice behavior as a matter of principle.",

abstract="Recommender systems help users find information by recommending content that a user might not know about, but will hopefully like. Rating-based collaborative filtering recommender systems do this by finding patterns that are consistent across the ratings of other users. These patterns can be used on their own, or in conjunction with other forms of social information access to identify and recommend content that a user might like. This chapter reviews the concepts, algorithms, and means of evaluation that are at the core of collaborative filtering research and practice. While there are many recommendation algorithms, the ones we cover serve as the basis for much of past and present algorithm development. After presenting these algorithms we present examples of two more recent directions in recommendation algorithms: learning-to-rank and ensemble recommendation algorithms. We finish by describing how collaborative filtering algorithms can be evaluated, and listing available resources and datasets to support further experimentation. The goal of this chapter is to provide the basis of knowledge needed for readers to explore more advanced topics in recommendation.",

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) filters the flow of data that can be recommended, by a Recommender System (RS), to a target user according to his taste and his preferences. The target userâ€™s profile is built based on his similarity with other users. For this reason, CF technique is very sensitive to the similarity measure used to quantify the dependency strength between two users (or two items). In this paper we provide an in-depth review on similarity measures used for CF-based RS. For each measure, we outline its fundamental background and we test its performance through an experimental study. Experiments are carried out on three standard datasets (MovieLens100k, MovieLens1M and Jester) and reveal many important conclusions. In fact, results show that ITR and IPWR are the most suitable similarity measures for a user-based RS while AMI is the best choice for an item-based RS. Evaluation metrics show that under the user-based approach, ITR obtains an MAE equal to 0.786 and 0.731 on MovieLens100k and MovieLens1M, respectively. Whereas, IPWR reach an MAE equal to 3.256 on Jester. Also, AMI gets under the item-based approach an MAE equal to 0.745, 0.724 and 3.281 on MovieLens100k, MovieLens1M and Jester, respectively.}
