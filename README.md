# STA5073Z-Recommender-Systems


This project focuses on developing a personalized book recommendation system using the Book-Crossing dataset. It implements three approaches: user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization to predict user preferences and providing personalized book recommendations.  The system's performance is enhanced through an ensemble model, which combines the strengths of each method, and is evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) to ensure accurate and relevant recommendations.
